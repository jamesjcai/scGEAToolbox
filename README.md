   - Click the **Add** button to install the toolbox.

5. **Launch scGEAToolbox**  
   - To start using scGEAToolbox, enter:
     ```matlab
     scgeatool
     ```
   - This will open the graphical user interface for single-cell transcriptomic data analysis.

### :: Method 2: Install via MATLAB Add-On (`.mltbx`)  
1. **Download** `scGEAToolbox.mltbx` from:  
   - ðŸ”— [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jamesjcai/scGEAToolbox/releases)  
   - ðŸ”— [MATLAB File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/72917-scgeatoolbox-single-cell-gene-expression-analysis-toolbox)  

2. **Install** the toolbox:  
   - **Double-click** `scGEAToolbox.mltbx`  
   - MATLAB will open the **Add-On Manager**  
   - Click **Install**  

3. **Verify the installation** by running:  
   ```matlab
   scgeatool
   ```

### :: Method 3: Install via GitHub (For Developers)   
1. **Run** the following code in MATLAB:  
    ```matlab
    unzip('https://github.com/jamesjcai/scGEAToolbox/archive/main.zip');  
    ```
2. **Add** the toolbox to the MATLAB path
     ```matlab
     addpath('./scGEAToolbox-main');
     savepath(fullfile(userpath,'pathdef.m'));
     % savepath;
     ```

## GUI interface

After installing the toolbox, the main GUI can be run by calling `scGEApp`.

## Analytical workflow built with scGEAToolbox

**Fig. 2. A software workflow built with scGEAToolbox for single-cell gene regulatory network (scGRN) analyses.** High-dimensional scRNA-seq data is filtered, normalized, and used as input for two paths. The first is a combination of (A) dimension-ality reduction and (B) trajectory/psedotime analysis to provide pseudotime-series data. The second is using network inference algorithms to generate (C) a global, coarse GRN structure. The integration of results from the two paths produces (D) pseudotime-series scGRNs, which can be further analyzed through regulatory modeling using parameter estimation algorithms to infer (E) a refined dynamic scGRN.

## SEE ALSO - Standalone Application

[SCGEATOOL.exe](https://scgeatool.github.io/) is a standalone application running on Windows machines that do not have MATLAB installed. SCGEATOOL is a lightweight and blazing fast desktop application that provides interactive visualization functionality to analyze single-cell transcriptomic data. SCGEATOOL allows you to easily interrogate different views of your scRNA-seq data to quickly gain insights into the underlying biology. SCGEATOOL is a pre-compiled standalone application developed in MATLAB. Pre-compiled standalone releases are meant for those environments without access to MATLAB licenses. Standalone releases provide access to all of the functionality of the SCGEATOOL standard MATLAB release encapsulated in a single application. SCGEATOOL is open-sourced to allow you to experience the added flexibility and speed of the MATLAB environment when needed.
