Gene Program Correlation Matrix	A matrix depicting the pairwise correlation between gene program activities (also known as co-variation scores) calculated across samples, as adjusted by permutations. This analysis helps identify significantly co-regulated gene programs and densely interconnected modules among cell compartments, visualized in heatmaps and network graphs. Statistical significance is assessed via permutation tests of sample identity. See https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34450029/ Fig. 5. (A) Heatmap showing permutation-adjusted pairwise correlation of gene program activities (co-variation score) across MMRd specimens (STAR Methods) using specimen-level activities in T/NK/ILC cell, myeloid, and malignant compartments. Significance is determined using permutation of patient ID and indicated with asterisks (FDR < 0.1). Densely connected modules (hubs) are identified based on graph clustering of significant correlation edges.

SGS Analysis [PMID:39828795]	Stochastic Gene Silencing (SGS) analysis utilizes natural variability in single-cell gene expression to assess gene function. For a gene of interest, cells are grouped as transcriptionally active or silenced for that gene, and compared to identify genes whose expression is sensitive to the presence or absence of the target, thereby revealing target gene function. Stochastic Gene Silencing (SGS) method leverages the natural variability in single-cell gene expression to decipher gene function. For a target gene g under investigation, scSGS classifies cells into transcriptionally active (g+) and silenced (g-) samples. It then compares these cell samples to identify differentially expressed genes, referred to as SGS-responsive genes, which are used to infer the function of the target gene g.

Geometric Sketching [PMID:31176620]	Geometric sketching summarizes large single-cell RNA-seq datasets by selecting a representative subset of cells (“sketch”), preserving transcriptional diversity. This approach accelerates analysis, enhances visualization, and improves detection of rare cell types. Large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies that profile hundreds of thousands of cells are becoming increasingly common, overwhelming existing analysis pipelines. Here, we describe how to enhance and accelerate single-cell data analysis by summarizing the transcriptomic heterogeneity within a dataset using a small subset of cells, which we refer to as a geometric sketch. Our sketches provide more comprehensive visualization of transcriptional diversity, capture rare cell types with high sensitivity, and reveal biological cell types via clustering.
MELD [PMID:33558698]	MELD estimates, at single-cell resolution, which cells are most affected by experimental perturbations by comparing per-cell sample density estimates, enabling identification of cells with the strongest experimental effects without relying on discrete clustering. The goal of MELD is to identify populations of cells that are most affected by an experimental perturbation. Rather than clustering the data first and calculating differential abundance of samples within clusters, MELD provides a density estimate for each scRNA-seq sample for every cell in each dataset. Comparing the ratio between the density of each sample provides a quantitative estimate the effect of a perturbation at the single-cell level. We can then identify the cells most or least affected by the perturbation.
DecontX [PMID:32138770]	DecontX employs a Bayesian approach to estimate and remove ambient RNA contamination in single-cell RNA-seq data, improving the accuracy of gene expression measurements by correcting for cross-sample contamination. Droplet-based microfluidic devices have become widely used to perform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). However, ambient RNA present in the cell suspension can be aberrantly counted along with a cell’s native mRNA and result in cross-contamination of transcripts between different cell populations. DecontX is a novel Bayesian method to estimate and remove contamination in individual cells. DecontX accurately predicts contamination levels in a mouse-human mixture dataset and removes aberrant expression of marker genes in PBMC datasets. We also compare the contamination levels between four different scRNA-seq protocols. Overall, DecontX can be incorporated into scRNA-seq workflows to improve downstream analyses.
Harmony [PMID:31740819]	Harmony integrates single-cell RNA-seq datasets from diverse conditions and technologies by projecting cells into a shared embedding, ensuring that cells group by biological similarity (e.g., cell type) rather than technical or experimental batch. The emerging diversity of single-cell RNA-seq datasets allows for the full transcriptional characterization of cell types across a wide variety of biological and clinical conditions. However, it is challenging to analyze them together, particularly when datasets are assayed with different technologies, because biological and technical differences are interspersed. We present Harmony, an algorithm that projects cells into a shared embedding in which cells group by cell type rather than dataset-specific conditions. Harmony simultaneously accounts for multiple experimental and biological factors.
Scrublet [PMID:30954476]	Scrublet is a tool to detect and flag 'multiplet' errors—instances where multiple cells share the same barcode—in single-cell RNA-seq data, reducing artifacts in downstream analysis by identifying likely multiplets computationally. ScRNA-seq experiments generate 'multiplet' errors when  multiple cells are labeled with the same barcode. Wolock et al. describe Scrublet, a method for predicting the effects of multiplets on downstream analyses and identifying problematic multiplets.
scTenifoldNet [PMID:33336197]	scTenifoldNet constructs gene regulatory networks from single-cell RNA-seq data using machine learning, then compares these networks across conditions or samples to reveal regulatory changes and identify key gene programs associated with biological processes. We present scTenifoldNet-a machine learning workflow built upon principal-component regression, low-rank tensor approximation, and manifold alignment-for constructing and comparing single-cell gene regulatory networks (scGRNs) using data from single-cell RNA sequencing. scTenifoldNet reveals regulatory changes in gene expression between samples by comparing the constructed scGRNs. With real data, scTenifoldNet identifies specific gene expression programs associated with different biological processes, providing critical insights into the underlying mechanism of regulatory networks governing cellular transcriptional activities.
scTenifoldKnk [PMID:35510185]	scTenifoldKnk performs in silico (virtual) gene knockout analysis by constructing gene regulatory networks from wild-type scRNA-seq data, virtually deleting the target gene, and identifying changes in regulation to infer gene function, paralleling real knockout experiments. Gene knockout (KO) experiments are a proven, powerful approach for studying gene function. However, systematic KO experiments targeting a large number of genes are usually prohibitive due to the limit of experimental and animal resources. Here, we present scTenifoldKnk, an efficient virtual KO tool that enables systematic KO investigation of gene function using data from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). In scTenifoldKnk analysis, a gene regulatory network (GRN) is first constructed from scRNA-seq data of wild-type samples, and a target gene is then virtually deleted from the constructed GRN. Manifold alignment is used to align the resulting reduced GRN to the original GRN to identify differentially regulated genes, which are used to infer target gene functions in analyzed cells. We demonstrate that the scTenifoldKnk-based virtual KO analysis recapitulates the main findings of real-animal KO experiments and recovers the expected functions of genes in relevant cell types.
GenKI [PMID:37246643]	GenKI is a virtual gene knockout tool that predicts the effects of deleting a gene using only wild-type scRNA-seq data. It uses a variational graph autoencoder to model gene regulatory networks, simulates the knockout by removing the gene’s edges, and compares the resulting networks to predict functional consequences. In this paper, we introduce Gene Knockout Inference (GenKI), a virtual knockout (KO) tool for gene function prediction
