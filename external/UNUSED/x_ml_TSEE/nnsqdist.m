% [D2,nn] = nnsqdist(X,k[,method]) Nearest-neighbor squared distances
%
% This computes the k nearest neighbors of each data point in X and its
% squared Euclidean distances:
% - D2(n,i) = squared distance from point X(n,:) to its ith nearest neighbor.
% - nn(n,i) = index of the ith nearest neighbor of X(n,:).
%
% Finding the nearest neighbors is done by default by sorting N distances for
% each point. If k<<N, a faster way is to use selection in O(N+k.logk) rather
% than sorting in O(N.logN). To use selection, install this package and set
% method='mink':
%   Min/Max selection
%   http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23576-minmax-selection
% Its mink() function selects the k smallest elements in the array with a
% partial quicksort in O(N+k.logk).
% Note that computing the distances between pairs of points is O(D.N? anyway,
% so the improvement of selection is larger the smaller D is.
%
% In:
%   X: NxD matrix of N row D-dimensional vectors.
%   k: number of nearest neighbors.
%   method: find nearest neighbors with sorting ('sort') or selection ('mink').
%      Default: 'sort'.
% Out:
%   D2: N x k matrix of sorted square distances to the k nearest neighbors.
%   nn: N x k matrix of indices of the corresponding nearest neighbors.
%
% Any non-mandatory argument can be given the value [] to force it to take
% its default value.
