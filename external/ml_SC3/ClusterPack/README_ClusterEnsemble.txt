CLUSTERENSEMBLE   README   Alexander Strehl   Version 2.0  2011-05-01
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This package contains a MATLAB implementation of the cluster
ensemble algorithms as described in
	  A. Strehl and J. Ghosh. "Cluster Ensembles - A Knowledge Reuse
	  Framework for Combining Multiple Partitions", Journal on
	  Machine Learning Research (JMLR), 3:583-617, December 2002
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To use it copy all eleven files
      ClusterEnsembleTest.m
      README_ClusterEnsemble.txt
      ceevalmutual.m
      clbtocl.m
      clstoclbs.m
      cltoclb.m
      clusterensemble.m
      cspa.m
      hgpa.m
      mcla.m
      norml.m
to a directory in your MATLAB path or the current directory in 
your MATLAB environment. Also, make sure that you have CLUSTERBASICS
installed. Then, in MATLAB just type
      clusterensemble;
to get an illustrative example or
      help clusterensemble
to get help on the usage of the function.
It has been tested on WIN7 Octave 3.2.4 and LNX86 Matlab 5.2.0.3084.
