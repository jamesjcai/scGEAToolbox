----------------------------------------------------------------------
This package contains a MATLAB implementation of the cluster
visualization tool CLUSION as described in
      A. Strehl and J. Ghosh, "Relationship-based Clustering and
      Visualization for High-dimensional Data Mining", Special
      Issue on Mining Web-based Data for E-Business Applications
      of the INFORMS Journal on Computing, 2002
and
      A. Strehl and J. Ghosh, "Relationship-based Visualization of
      High-dimensional Data Clusters", Proc. of Workshop on Visual
      Data Mining (KDD 2001), Aug. 2001, pp. 90-99 
----------------------------------------------------------------------      
To use it copy all seven files
      ClusterVisualTest.m
      README_ClusterVisual.txt
      clusion.m
      imageshq.m
      perminv.m
      renumtick.m
      retick.m
to a directory in your MATLAB path or the current directory in 
your MATLAB environment. Then, in MATLAB just type
      clusion;
to get an illustrative example or
      help clusion
to get help on the usage of the function.
It has been tested on LNX86 Matlab 5.2.0.3084 and PCWIN 5.3.0.14912a (R11).
