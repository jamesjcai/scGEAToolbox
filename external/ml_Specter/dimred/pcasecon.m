function [U, T, mu] = pcasecon(X, k)
% Input:
% X : m x n matrix
% Each column of X is a feature vector
%
% Output:
% X = U*T approximately (up to k)
%
% Description:
% Principal Component Analysis (PCA) while trying to conserve memory and be faster
% Requires that k <= min(m,n) where [m,n] = size(X)
% This function is useful if k is much smaller than m and n
% or if X is sparse (see doc eigs)
