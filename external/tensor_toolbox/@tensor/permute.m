function T = permute(T, order)
%PERMUTE Permute tensor dimensions.
%
%   B = PERMUTE(A,ORDER) rearranges the dimensions of A so that they
%   are in the order specified by the vector ORDER. The result has the
%   same values of A, but the order of the subscripts needed to access
%   any particular element are rearranged as specified by ORDER.
%
%   Examples
%   T = tensor(rand(3,2,4));
%   permute(T,[1 3 2])
